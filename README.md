# SecScanner - WiFi Evil Twin Detection System

SecScanner is a full-stack AI-powered WiFi security scanner that detects **evil twin access points**—malicious wireless networks that impersonate legitimate ones to steal data. It combines a React frontend with a Flask + Scikit-learn backend and utilizes Isolation Forest anomaly detection to identify suspicious network behavior.

## 📡 How It Works

1. **Scan WiFi Networks** using `pywifi` (signal strength, SSID, BSSID, vendor, channel).
2. **Save historical scans** to CSV (`wifi_scans_rich.csv`).
3. **Train ML Model**: Isolation Forest identifies anomalous (potentially evil twin) access points based on:

   * Signal deviation
   * Channel inconsistency
   * Vendor patterns
4. **Detect Suspicious Networks** and display them in the UI with confidence score.
5. **Filter by SSID or type (Suspicious / Normal)** in real time.

## 📊 Detection Logic

| Feature              | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signal Strength**  | Mean and standard deviation used to detect inconsistencies |
| **Channel Analysis** | Checks for uncommon frequency changes                      |
| **BSSID Uniqueness** | Identifies duplicates across networks                      |
| **Vendor Patterns**  | Uses OUI lookups to identify vendor legitimacy             |

## 🔐 Evil Twin Attack?

An **evil twin attack** occurs when a malicious actor sets up a rogue WiFi AP with the same SSID as a legitimate network. This tricks users into connecting, exposing sensitive data.

This scanner aims to **proactively detect such threats** using AI and scanning.

## 📎 Future Improvements

* 🔐 WPA handshake analysis
* 📍 Geo-tagging of scan results
* 📚 Graph-based anomaly models
* ⏱️ Periodic background scanning

> **Prompt:**

I have a full-stack project called **SecScanner**. It is an AI-powered WiFi security scanner built using a React frontend and Python Flask backend. The scanner uses `pywifi` to collect live WiFi data (SSID, BSSID, Signal strength, etc.) and saves it into a CSV.

The backend uses `IsolationForest` from Scikit-learn to analyze the historical WiFi scan data and detect anomalous behavior that could represent **evil twin attacks** (malicious networks impersonating legitimate ones).

The frontend visualizes detected networks, suspicious activity, and signal statistics. Users can filter by SSID or type (suspicious/normal), view detection confidence, and rescan anytime. There's a theme toggle and an explanation section of how the ML-based detection works.
